      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

			<string>Terms of Use of Yandex.Metrica service
This document is a translation of Terms of use of Yandex.Metrica service in English. In case of conflict between the Russian version of Terms of use of Yandex.Metrica service and this translation - only the Russian version of Terms of use of Yandex.Metrica service is legally binding. The Russian version of Terms of use of Yandex.Metrica service can be found here: http://www.legal.yandex.ru/metrica_termsofuse/?lang=ru.

This document, Terms of Use of Yandex.Metrica Service (hereinafter - Agreement) is an offer of YANDEX, LLC (hereinafter - Yandex) to an Internet user (hereinafter - User) to conclude an agreement on the use of the service Yandex.Metrica (hereinafter - Service) on the conditions stated below.

1. The use of the Service by the User is regulated by this Agreement, as well as:

the User Agreement for Yandex services, available at: http://legal.yandex.com/rules/,

Privacy Policy, available at: http://legal.yandex.com/confidential/,

(Hereinafter collectively referred to as - Regulatory Documents).

The User undertakes to acquaint himself with all Regulatory Documents, and shall bear the risk of failure of such acquaintance.

2. This Agreement and the relations between Yandex and the User arisen in connection to use of the Service, are subject to the applicable laws of the Russian Federation. Throughout the text of this Agreement, unless directly stated otherwise, the term legislation means legislation of the Russian Federation as well as legislation of the User?s place of residence.

3. Having registered at the Service, received a counter code, placed the counter code on the User's site or used any other function of the Service, the User expresses its unconditional consent with all terms of this Agreement and undertakes to comply with them or stop using the Service, by removing the related code from the User's site.

4. When using the Service, the User must comply with the following conditions and limitations:

to have a login on Yandex and place the counter code on his website. Yandex has a right to deny access to the Service without explanation;

not to remove or alter hyperlinks to the resources of Yandex contained in the counter code;

not to install the counter code on sites that do not meet the requirements of paragraph 5 of the User Agreement for Yandex services;

not to alter or in any way modify the program counter code, obtained through the Service, except for the change of the User's website settings;

not to use any automatic programs or devices to register on Yandex and/or to receive a counter code, except for programs working with the API Yandex.Metrica;

comply with all requirements of this Agreement and the current legislation on the protection of personal data and correspondence of the User?s website visitors, as well as other information, access to which is limited according to the legislation, and that can be recorded while using the Service.

5. The User shall be responsible for safekeeping of his login and password and may not transfer or disclose it to third parties. All the actions taken by the Service under the User?s login and password, are considered as accomplished by the User.

6. The Service (including the information obtained with its help) is provided by Yandex ?as is?. Yandex does not warrant the fitness of the Service for the purposes and expectations of Users, uninterruptable and error-free operation of the Service in general and the counter installed on the User?s website, in particular, and does not warrant the accuracy of the information obtained through the Service. Yandex shall not be liable for any damage, direct or indirect, caused to the User or any third party by use or inability to use the Service and/or counters installed on the User's website, as well as by use or inability to use the information obtained through the Service. Yandex shall not reimburse the User or any third party for such damages.

7. The User is solely responsible before third parties for his actions when using the Service, including the fact that they meet the requirements of the legislation and do not violate the rights and legitimate interests of third parties. The User shall settle all claims of third parties associated with the actions of the User when using the Service at his own expense.

8. The User is hereby notified and agrees that once the function WebVisor is switched on since the installation of the counter to the pages of the User, the Service provides the User with functional ability to automatically record sessions of visits by the visitors of the pages on the User?s website (hereinafter ?Visit Sessions). Yandex does not place such records of Visit Sessions on open access and does not provide such records of Visit Sessions to third parties, except for those records the access to which were provided by the User himself.

9. The User shall at his own risk and discretion switch on the function of the Service WebVisor, define the amount of information on the User?s website, being recorded by the counter. The User can mark specific fields of pages of the User?s web site with a special CSS-class http://help.yandex.com/metrica/qanda/webvisor-qanda.xml#skip-fields (in the HTML-code of pages of the website) for the input of data in such fields by third parties (visitors of the User?s website) not to be recorded during recording of Visit Sessions by the counter and at his own discretion and risk make a decision on the choice of fields for such marks and is solely responsible for recording data in the fields which do not have such a mark.

10. The User acknowledges and agrees that the counter installed on the User?s website collects anonymous (without binding to the personal data of visitors of the web site) data on visits of the User?s web site and automatically forwards them to Yandex for generalized statistical information available for the further use of the Service by the User and by Yandex as well. If the User did not include a restriction to send pages of the web site for indexing (http://help.yandex.com/metrica/code/stop-indexing.xml), the addresses (URL) of pages with the installed counter can be forwarded for indexing by Yandex.
